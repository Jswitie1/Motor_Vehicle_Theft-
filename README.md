Motor Vehicle Theft.


This is my first project on Github and it is a visualization of a motor vehicle theft , the dataset was gotten from Maven analytics data  playground, I used PowerBI, PowerQuery and DAX for the analysis. This encompasses of different regions and locations where theft occur , the type of cars stolen, number of regions, average density in all locations, average population, total number of vehicles stolen ,years in average of vehicles, top and least 5 most stolen vehicle types and number of thefts in a day .
